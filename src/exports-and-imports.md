# Exports and imports

Setting up the API to talk to your WebAssembly module.

## Exports

Exports work very much like in TypeScript, with the notable difference that exports from an entry file also become the exports of the resulting WebAssembly module.

### Functions

```ts
export function add(a: i32, b: i32): i32 {
  return a + b
}
```

### Globals

```ts
export const foo = 1
export var bar = 2
```

Exporting or importing mutable globals requires that the engine supports the post-MVP and now standardized [Import/Export mutable globals proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/mutable-global), which is enabled by default.

### Classes

If an entire class \(possibly part of a namespace\) is exported from an entry file, its visible members will become distinct module exports using a JSDoc-like naming scheme that [the loader](./loader.md) understands to make a nice object structure of. For example

```ts
export namespace foo {
  export class Bar {
    a: i32 = 1
    getA(): i32 { return this.a }
  }
}
```

will yield the raw function exports

* foo.Bar\#**constructor**
* foo.Bar\#**get:a**
* foo.Bar\#**set:a**
* foo.Bar\#**getA**

which the loader combines back to a `foo.Bar` object:

```js
var bar = new myModule.foo.Bar()
bar.a = 2
console.log(bar.a)
```

Under the hood and without the loader, it'd look like this:

```js
var thisBar = myModule["foo.Bar#constructor"](0)
myModule["foo.Bar#set:a"](thisBar, 2)
console.log(myModule["foo.Bar#get:a"](thisBar))
```

As one can see the `this` argument must be provided as an additional first argument to the raw functions. No argument or `0` as the first argument to a constructor indicates that the constructor is expected to allocate on its own \(not extending a class with existing memory\). Of course one usually doesn't have to deal with these internals since the loader will already take care of it.

## Imports

With [WebAssembly ES Module Integration](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration) still in the pipeline, imports utilize the ambient context currently. For example

```ts
// env.ts
export declare function doSomething(foo: i32): void
```

creates an import of a function named `doSomething` from the `env` module, because that's the name of the file it lives is. It is also possible to use namespaces:

```ts
// foo.ts
export declare namespace console {
  export function logi(i: i32): void
  export function logf(f: f64): void
}
```

This will import the functions `console.logi` and `console.logf` from the `foo` module. Bonus: Don't forget `export`ing namespace members if you'd like to call them from outside the namespace.

A typical pattern is to `declare` the interface of each external module in its own file, using the name of the module as its file name, so the external module can be imported as if it was just another source file:

```ts
import { doSomething } from "./env";
import { console } from "./foo";
```

### Custom naming

Where automatic naming is not sufficient, the `@external` decorator can be used to give an element another external name:

```ts
// bar.ts
@external("doSomethingElse")
export declare function doSomething(foo: i32): void
// imports doSomethingElse from bar as doSomething

@external("foo", "baz")
export declare function doSomething(foo: i32): void
// imports baz from foo as doSomething
```

## On values crossing the boundary

More complex values than the basic integer and floating point types, like class instances or function references, are represented by an index or pointer within the WebAssembly module. The compiler knows how to work with these because it also knows the concrete type associated with the value. On the outside, however, for example in JS-code interacting with a WebAssembly module, all that's seen is the basic value.

* An **instance of a class** is a pointer to the structure in WebAssembly memory.
* A **function reference** is the index of the function in the WebAssembly table.

This is true in both directions, hence also applies when providing a value to a WebAssembly import. The most common structures like `String`, `ArrayBuffer` and the typed arrays are documented in [memory internals](./memory.md#internals), and custom classes adhere to [class layout](./interoperability.md#class-layout).

## Anatomy of a module

WebAssembly modules produced by the AssemblyScript compiler typically have the following set of imports and exports in addition to those defined in user code, with `?` indicating conditional presence. Recommended scenarios like using modules together with the [loader](./loader.md) or utilizing WASI via `import "wasi"` take care of these automatically.

### Exports

* ```ts
  const memory: WebAssembly.Memory
  ```
  The module's memory instance. Can be disabled with `--noExportMemory`.

* ```ts
  const table?: WebAssembly.Table
  ```
  The module's function table instance. Can be enabled with `--exportTable`.

* ```ts
  function _start?(): void
  ```
  Explicit start function to call. Can be enabled with `--explicitStart`. Also works with WASI.

* ```ts
  function __setArgumentsLength?(numArgs: i32): void
  ```
  Varargs helper to set what's known as `arguments.length` in JavaScript. Only present if there is at least one export of a function taking a variable number of arguments. Automatically utilized by the [loader](./loader.md).

* ```ts
  function __alloc?(size: usize, id: u32): usize
  function __retain?(ptr: usize): usize
  function __release?(ptr: usize): void
  function __collect?(): void
  ```
  [Runtime helpers](../details/runtime.md). Only present on `--runtime stub/full`. Not present on `--runtime none/half`.

### Imports

* ```ts
  const env.memory?: WebAssembly.Memory
  ```
  The module's memory instance. Can be enabled with `--importMemory`.

* ```ts
  const env.table?: WebAssembly.Table
  ```
  The module's table instance. Can be enabled with `--importTable`.

* ```ts
  function env.abort?(message: usize, fileName: usize, line: u32, column: u32): void
  ```
  Called on unrecoverable errors. Typically present if assertions are enabled. Automatically implemented by the [loader](./loader.md). Not present but otherwise implemented on `import "wasi"`.

* ```ts
  function env.trace?(message: usize, n: i32, a0..4?: f64): void
  ```
  Called when `trace` is called in user code. Only present if it is. Automatically implemented by the [loader](./loader.md). Not present but otherwise implemented on `import "wasi"`.

* ```ts
  function env.seed?(): f64
  ```
  Called when the random number generator needs to be seeded. Only present if it is. Automatically implemented by the [loader](./loader.md). Not present but otherwise implemented on `import "wasi"`.
