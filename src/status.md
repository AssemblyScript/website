# Status

Not all language features are equally viable to implement on top of WebAssembly's current feature set. There is still a lot to do.

## WebAssembly features

Some crucial language features rely on [not yet available WebAssembly functionality](https://github.com/WebAssembly/proposals) to be efficient. The following table aims to give an overview from a WebAssembly perspective:

| WebAssembly spec    | Engines                  | AssemblyScript (flag)   | What's the plan?

## Language features

As such, certain higher-level language features still have their limitations or are not yet available. From a language perspective:

| Feature                | What to expect?
|------------------------|-----------------
| üê§ **Functional**
| [Classes and interfaces](#classes-and-interfaces) | Largely implemented in linear memory. Some caveats. (needs GC ü¶Ñ)
| [Standard library](#standard-library) | Largely implemented in linear memory. Some caveats.
| [Garbage collection](#garbage-collection) | Implemented in linear memory for now. (needs GC ü¶Ñ)
| [Interop with JS](#interop-with-js) | Enabled by the loader package. (needs Type imports / Interface Types ü¶Ñ)
|
| üê£ **Limited**
| [Union types](#union-types) | Nullable class types only. Can use generics with static type checks instead. (No proposal so far)
|
| ü•ö **Not implemented**
| [Closures](#closures) | Perhaps implement in linear memory. (needs Function references ü¶Ñ)
| [Iterators](#iterators) | Iterators depend on closures.
| [Rest parameters](#rest-parameters) | Perhaps implement in linear memory. (No proposal so far)
| [Exceptions](#exceptions) | Throwing currently aborts the program. (needs Exception handling ü¶Ñ)
| [Promises](#promises) | There is no concept of async/await yet due to the lack of an event loop. (No proposal so far)
|
| üï≥Ô∏è **Not supported**
| [Dynamicness](#dynamicness) | AssemblyScript avoids overly dynamic JavaScript features by design.

### Classes and interfaces

These mostly work, with a a few caveats, especially when it comes to interfaces. The easiest workaround is typically to use a class.

### Standard library

Some [standard library APIs](./stdlib/globals.md) function a little different than in JavaScript to account for differences introduced by static typing or missing WebAssembly features. We are also maintaining a [separate status document](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/wiki/Status-and-Roadmap) specific to the standard library.

### Garbage collection

[Garbage collection](./garbage-collection.md) is currently implemented in linear memory, independent from the host, and is best paired with [the loader](./loader.md) for interop.

### Interop with JS

WebAssembly only understands numeric values as of today and cannot easily exchange objects with JavaScript. Hence, when an object is returned from WebAssembly to JavaScript or vice-versa, what the caller passes and the callee receives is a pointer to the object in linear memory. For now, [the loader](./loader.md) provides the utility necessary to translate between objects in linear memory and JavaScript objects, and our hopes are on Type Imports ü¶Ñ, Interface Types ü¶Ñ and perhaps Garbage collection ü¶Ñ to make interop more convenient eventually.

### Union types

WebAssembly cannot efficiently represent locals or globals of dynamic types, so union types are not supported in AssemblyScript. One can however take advantage of the fact that AssemblyScript is a static compiler, with monomorphized generics and [static type checks](./environment.md#static-type-checks), to achieve a similar effect:

```ts
function addOrConcat<T>(a: T, b: T): T {
  return a + b; // concats if a string, otherwise adds
}

function addOrSomethingElse<T>(a: T, b: T): T {
  if (isString<T>()) {
    return "something else"; // eliminated if T is not a string
  } else {
    return a + b; // eliminated if T is a string
  }
}
```

Another effect of the above is that AssemblyScript does not have an `any` type or `undefined` value.

### Closures

Closures (functions with a captured environment) are not yet supported and we are waiting for the Function References ü¶Ñ and Garbage collection ü¶Ñ (captured environments are GC'ed) proposals to land. However, since this is a crucial language feature, we may end up with a filler implementation using linear memory. Not available yet, though.

In the meantime we recommend to restructure code so closures are not necessary, i.e. instead of writing

```ts
function computeSum(arr: i32[]): i32 {
  var sum = 0
  arr.forEach(value => {
    sum += value // fails
  })
  return sum
}
```

restructure to

```ts
var sum: i32 // becomes a WebAssembly Global
function computeSum(arr: i32[]): i32 {
  sum = 0
  arr.forEach(value => {
    sum += value // works
  })
  return sum
}
```

or to

```ts
function computeSum(arr: i32[]): i32 {
  var sum = 0
  for (let i = 0, k = arr.length; i < k; ++i) {
    sum += arr[i] // works
  }
  return sum
}
```

### Iterators

To make proper use of JavaScript iterators, it is necessary to first implement closures. Therefore `for ... of` loops are not currently supported. To work around this limitation, affected standard library APIs return an array for now:

#### Map\<K,V>

* ```ts
  function keys(): Array<K>
  ```

* ```ts
  function values(): Array<V>
  ```

#### Set\<T>

* ```ts
  function values(): Array<T>
  ```

### Rest parameters

It has not yet been attempted to implement variadic functions due to uncertainty how efficient it will be without random stack access. The risk is that doing dynamic allocations instead may introduce an unfortunate hidden cost to function calls.

In the meantime, optional function arguments, which do not have such a hidden cost, may be able to help:

```ts
function handleGiven(a: i32, b: i32 = -1, c: i32 = -1): void {
  handle(a);
  if (~b) {
    handle(b);
    if (~c) {
      handle(c);
    }
  }
}
```

### Exceptions

Exceptions are not yet supported and we are waiting for the Exception handling ü¶Ñ proposal to land. It is not yet feasible to implement exceptions without the help of the proposal, so the following will currently crash the program with a call to `abort("message", ...)`:

```ts
function doThrow(): void {
  throw new Error("message")
}
```

In the meantime we recommend to do as they did in the olden days and return an error code or `null` to indicate an exception.

### Promises

The concept of async execution requires an underlying concept of an event loop, which browsers and Node.js have but WebAssembly does not. In the meantime, it is recommended to stick to synchronous code within WebAssembly or call back into WebAssembly when an external async operation completes.

### Dynamicness

AssemblyScript intentionally avoids very dynamic JavaScript features that cannot be compiled efficiently, like for example:

* Assigning any value to any variable.
* Compare values of incompatible types.
* Implicitly convert from a non-string to a string. Should use `x.toString()`.
* Assign a new property, that has not been statically declared, to a class or object.
* Assign a class to a variable (e.g. `var clazz = MyClass`) since classes are static constructs without a runtime representation.
* Patch class `.prototype`s since there are none.
* Access `arguments` to dynamically obtain function arguments.

Some of these restrictions, like implicit conversion to strings when concatenating with a string, may be lifted in the future, while others, like prototypes, may never be viable in ahead-of-time compilation. For instance, some features would work in an interpreter and may become efficient with a JIT compiler, yet going down that rabbit hole runs counter to WebAssembly's, and by definition AssemblyScript's, goals.
