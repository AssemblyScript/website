# Loader

AssemblyScript provides a tiny [module loader](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/tree/master/lib/loader) that makes working with AssemblyScript modules as convenient as it gets without sacrificing efficiency. It about mirrors the relevant parts of the WebAssembly API while also providing utility to allocate and read strings, arrays and classes.

```ts
const loader = require("@assemblyscript/loader")
loader.instantiate(
  // Binary to instantiate
  fetch("optimized.wasm"), // or fs.readFileSync
                           // or fs.promises.readFile
                           // or just a buffer
  // Additional imports
  { ... }
).then({ exports } => {
  ...
})
```

The loader basically instantiates the module using `WebAssembly` APIs, but also adds additional utility to it while evaluating export names and making a nice object structure of them. For example, if one exports an entire class `Foo` from the module, there will be an `exports.Foo` constructor etc. available when using the loader.

::: tip NOTE
Some of the loader's functionality, like allocating strings and arrays, requires the [managed runtime](./runtime.md) interface to be exported to the host, i.e. the `full` or `stub` runtimes to be used.
:::

## Installation

For each version of the AssemblyScript compiler, there is a standalone version of the loader that can be installed from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@assemblyscript/loader):

```sh
npm install --save @assemblyscript/loader
```

::: tip
If you need a [specific version](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/releases) of the loader, append the respective version number as usual. For each nightly version of the compiler there is a respective nightly of the loader as well.
:::

## Usage

One task the loader does not perform is to implicitly translate between WebAssembly pointers and JavaScript objects, and that's where the mixed in utility comes into play. For example, if one has

```ts
// AssemblyScript
export function concat(a: string, b: string): string {
  return a + b
}
```

and then wants to call `concat` externally, the string arguments cannot just be JavaScript strings but must first be allocated in the module's memory with their lifetime tracked, like so:

```js
// JavaScript
const { concat } = myModule.exports
const { __allocString, __getString, __retain, __release } = myModule.exports

function doConcat(aStr, bStr) {
  let aPtr = __retain(__allocString(aStr))
  let bPtr = __retain(__allocString(bStr))
  let cPtr = concat(aPtr, bPtr) // call with pointers
  let cStr = __getString(cPtr)
  __release(aPtr) // we are done with aPtr
  __release(bPtr) // we are done with bPtr
  __release(cPtr) // we are done with cPtr
  return cStr
}

console.log(doConcat("Hello ", "world!"))
```

### Counting references

While the above code snippet might look intimidating at first, it isn't that hard to get used to. One can think of `__retain` as incrementing the reference count by 1 so the object does not become collected while we are working with it, and of `__release` as decrementing the reference count by 1 again, allowing it to become collected once we don't need a reference to it anymore. That's necessary because the module uses automatic reference counting (ARC) internally, so it needs a bit of cooperation when working with its managed objects externally.

Note that we don't need to retain a reference to the value returned by `concat` in the above snippet, because return values become automatically retained for the caller. A few general rules:

* Retain a reference when `__allocXY`ing a string, array or object and release it again when done with it.
* Don't forget to release a reference to a managed object returned by the module, even if the return value is not used.
* Does not apply to basic values like `i32`s or `f64`s since these aren't objects (don't retain or release these).

### Creating arrays

Arrays (or more advanced classes for that matter) require a bit more cooperation because we need to know their value type in order to work with them properly. To achieve this, every class has a unique id internally, and a chunk of runtime type information (RTTI) is shipped with the module to evaluate class types. Here's an example of working with an `Int32Array`:

```ts
// AssemblyScript
export function sum(arr: Int32Array): i32 {
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0, k = arr.length; i < k; ++i) {
    sum += unchecked(arr[i])
  }
  return sum
}
export const Int32Array_ID = idof<Int32Array>()
```

```js
// JavaScript
const { sum, Int32Array_ID } = myModule.exports
const { __allocArray, _retain, __release } = myModule.exports

function doSum(values) {
  const arrPtr = __retain(__allocArray(Int32Array_ID, values))
  const value = sum(arrPtr)
  __release(arrPtr)
  return value
}

console.log(doSum([1, 2, 3]))
```

This works with all kinds of arrays, except that ids are different and values are interpreted differently, of course.

### Reading arrays

If one is instead interested in the values of an array being returned by the module, there are two approaches to this. Let's say we have the following module:

```ts
// AssemblyScript
export function getRandomArray(len: i32): Int32Array {
  const arr = new Int32Array(len)
  // fill with random values
  return arr
}
```

The first is, obviously, to read the array's values from the module's memory by essentially copying them to a JS array

```js
// JavaScript
const { getRandomArray } = myModule.exports
const { __getArray, __release } = myModule.exports

function doGetRandomArray(len) {
  const arrPtr = getRandomArray(len)
  const values = __getArray(arrPtr)
  __release(arrPtr)
  return values
}

console.log(doGetRandomArray(10))
```

which is always safe, while the second is to create a live view on the array, enabling two-way modification of its values:

```js
// JavaScript
const { getRandomArray } = myModule.exports
const { __getArrayView, __release } = myModule.exports

function doGetRandomArrayView(len) {
  const ptr = getRandomArray(len)
  const view = __getArrayView(ptr)
  // do not __release(ptr) yet, but do it once done with the view
  return { ptr, view }
}

const randomArray = doGetRandomArrayView(10)
console.log(randomArray.view)
__release(randomArray.ptr)
```

The latter variant can be more efficient (and useful) but is a little dangerous because the view may become detached from the module's memory when memory automatically grows. Also, the viewed array can grow automatically when pushed to, with the view then referencing random memory. Pushing to an array can be avoided quite easily, yet it is notoriously hard to predict when module memory grows - but one can try to set a sufficiently large size of `--initialMemory` or defensively trigger a sufficiently large dynamic allocation being freed immediately before dealing with potentially problematic views.

### Custom classes

As mentioned earlier, the loader understands how to make a nice object structure of a module's exports, and it is possible to utilize it to work with classes in a more natural way. For example, when calling the following function externally

```ts
// AssemblyScript
export class Foo {
  constructor(public str: string) {}
  getString(): string {
    return this.str
  }
}

export function getFoo(): Foo { // this one
  return new Foo("Hello world!")
}
```

one can wrap the received pointer in a `myModule.exports.Foo` instance:

```js
// JavaScript
const { Foo, getFoo } = myModule.exports
const { __getString, __release } = myModule

const fooPtr = getFoo()
const foo = Foo.wrap(fooPtr)
const strPtr = foo.getString()
console.log(__getString(str))
__release(strPtr)
__release(fooPtr)
```

::: warning
Remember that pointers to managed objects returned by the module must be `__release`d when done with them. This is also true for property getters, including those automatically generated for fields. Even though the loader abstracts these away to property accesses like `foo.str`, getters are still represented by exported functions under the hood.
:::

## API

For reference, here comes the full API provided by the loader.

::: tip
Copying from and extending the examples above is typically sufficient.
:::

### Static members

* ```ts
  function instantiate<T>(
    moduleOrBuffer: WasmInstantiable,
    imports?: WasmImports
  ): Promise<ASUtil & T>
  ```
  Asynchronously instantiates an AssemblyScript module from anything that can be instantiated.

* ```ts
  function instantiateSync<T>(
    moduleOrBuffer: WasmInstantiable,
    imports?: WasmImports
  ): ASUtil & T
  ```
  Synchronously instantiates an AssemblyScript module from a WebAssembly.Module or binary buffer. Not recommended.

* ```ts
  function instantiateStreaming<T>(
    response: Response | PromiseLike<Response>,
    imports?: WasmImports
  ): Promise<ASUtil & T>
  ```
  Asynchronously instantiates an AssemblyScript module from a response, i.e. as obtained by fetch.

* ```ts
  function demangle<T>(
    exports: WasmExports,
    baseModule?: Object
  ): T
  ```
  Demangles an AssemblyScript module's exports to a friendly object structure. You usually don't have to call this manually as instantiation does this implicitly.

Note that `T` above can either be omitted if the shape of the module is unknown, or can reference a `.d.ts` (i.e. `typeof MyModule`) as produced by the compiler with the `-d` option.

### Module instance utility

The following utility functions are mixed into the module's exports.

* ```ts
  function __allocString(str: string): number
  ```
  Allocates a new string in the module's memory and returns a pointer to it.

* ```ts
  function __allocArray(id: number, values: number[]): number
  ```
  Allocates a new array in the module's memory and returns a pointer to it. Automatically retains interior pointers. The `id` is the unique runtime id of the respective array class. If you are using `Int32Array` for example, the best way to know the id is an `export const Int32Array_ID = idof<Int32Array>()`. When done with the array, make sure to `__release` it.

* ```ts
  function __getString(ptr: number): string
  ```
  Copies a string's value from the module's memory to a JavaScript string. `ptr` must not be zero.

* ```ts
  function __getArrayBuffer(ptr: number): ArrayBuffer
  ```
  Copies an ArrayBuffer's value from the module's memory to a JavaScript buffer. `ptr` must not be zero.

* ```ts
  function __getArray(ptr: number): number[]
  ```
  Copies an array's values from the module's memory to a JavaScript array. Infers the array type from RTTI. `ptr` must not be zero.

* ```ts
  function __getArrayView(ptr: number): TypedArray
  ```
  Gets a live view on the values of an array in the module's memory. Infers the array type from RTTI. `ptr` must not be zero.

  This differs from `__getArray` in that the data isn't copied but remains live in both directions. That's faster but also unsafe because if the array grows or becomes released, the view will no longer represent the correct memory region and modifying its values in this state will most likely corrupt memory or otherwise explode. Use, but use with care.

* ```ts
  function __getInt8ArrayView(ptr: number): Int8Array
  function __getUint8ArrayView(ptr: number): Uint8Array
  function __getUint8ClampedArrayView(ptr: number): Uint8ClampedArray
  function __getInt16ArrayView(ptr: number): Int16Array
  function __getUint16ArrayView(ptr: number): Uint16Array
  function __getInt32ArrayView(ptr: number): Int32Array
  function __getUint32ArrayView(ptr: number): Uint32Array
  function __getInt64ArrayView(ptr: number): BigInt64Array
  function __getUint64ArrayView(ptr: number): BigUint64Array
  function __getFloat32ArrayView(ptr: number): Float32Array
  function __getFloat64ArrayView(ptr: number): Float64Array
  ```
  Slightly more efficient variants of `__getArrayView` where the type of the array is know beforehand. Doesn't try to infer the type.

### Module instance runtime interface

The runtime interface is directly exported by the module, so also present as part of the module's exports. Also see the [managed runtime](./runtime.md) documentation for all the details.

* ```ts
  function __retain(ptr: number): number
  ```
  Retains a reference to a managed object represented by a pointer to it, making sure that it doesn't become collected prematurely. Returns the pointer.

* ```ts
  function __release(ptr: number): void
  ```
  Releases a previously retained reference to a managed object, allowing the runtime to collect it once its reference count reaches zero.

* ```ts
  function __alloc(size: number, id: number): number
  ```
  Allocates an instance of the class represented by the specified id. If you are using `MyClass` for example, the best way to know the id and the necessary size is an `export const MYCLASS_ID = idof<MyClass>()` and an `export const MYCLASS_SIZE = offsetof<MyClass>()`. Afterwards, use the respective views to assign values to the class's memory while making sure to retain interior references to other managed objects once. When done with the class, make sure to `__release` it, which will automatically release any interior references once the class becomes collected.

* ```ts
  function __instanceof(ptr: number, baseId: number): boolean
  ```
  Tests whether an object is an instance of the class represented by the specified `baseId`.

* ```ts
  function __collect(): void
  ```
  Forces a cycle collection. Only relevant if objects potentially forming reference cycles are used.

## Convenience vs. efficiency

Making the loader's API any more convenient has its tradeoffs. One would either have to include extended type information with the module itself or generate an additional JavaScript file of glue code that does (and hides) all the lifting. As such, one can consider the loader as a small and efficient building block that can do it all, yet does not sacrifice efficiency. The design choice here is that an efficient helper can be wrapped in a way that it becomes more convenient, but it's often not possible anymore to make a convenient helper more efficient the other way around. However, if that's not exactly what you are looking for, take a look at more convenient tools below. Just remember that these have tradeoffs.

### More convenient tools

* [as-bind](https://github.com/torch2424/as-bind) is a library, built on top of the loader, to make passing high-level data structures between AssemblyScript and JavaScript more convenient.

## Advanced usage

### Direct memory access

All of the above can be mixed with direct [memory](./memory.md) accesses on `myModule.exports.memory.buffer`, for instance by adhering to [class layout](./interoperability.md#class-layout). Just note that directly loading a pointer (to a managed object) from the module's memory also requires `__retain`ing a reference (unlike `return` values that become retained for the caller automatically).

### TypeScript definitions

The compiler is able to emit definitions using the `-d` command line option that are compatible with modules demangled by the loader, and these can be used for proper typings in development:

```ts
// TypeScript
import MyModule from "myModule"; // pointing at the generated d.ts

loader.instatiate<typeof MyModule>(
  fetch("myModule.wasm"),
  { ... }
).then({ exports } => {
  ...
})
```

### Non-JS environments

Also, if the host environment is not JavaScript, the runtime interface utilized by the loader is of course still available as part of the module's exports (minus the loader utilities, [see](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/blob/master/lib/loader/index.js)), so one can work with managed objects in a similar way when embedding an AssemblyScript module into a C++ or Rust host by sticking to what the loader would do.
