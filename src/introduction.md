# Introduction

AssemblyScript compiles a **strict variant** of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) \(a typed superset of JavaScript\) to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), looking like:

```ts
export function fib(n: i32): i32 {
  var a = 0, b = 1
  for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
    let t = a + b; a = b; b = t
  }
  return b
}
```

```sh
asc fib.ts -b fib.wasm -O3
```

```wasm
(module
 (type $i32_=>_i32 (func (param i32) (result i32)))
 (memory $0 0)
 (export "memory" (memory $0))
 (export "fib" (func $fib/fib))
 (func $fib/fib (param $0 i32) (result i32)
  (local $1 i32)
  (local $2 i32)
  (local $3 i32)
  (local $4 i32)
  i32.const 1
  local.set $1
  i32.const 2
  local.set $4
  loop $for-loop|0
   local.get $4
   local.get $0
   i32.lt_s
   if
    local.get $1
    local.get $2
    i32.add
    local.get $1
    local.set $2
    local.set $1
    local.get $4
    i32.const 1
    i32.add
    local.set $4
    br $for-loop|0
   end
  end
  local.get $1
 )
)
```

Its architecture differs from a JavaScript VM in that it compiles a program **ahead of time**, quite similar to other static compilers. One can think of it as a mix of TypeScript's syntax and C's capabilities.

## In a nutshell

On top of [WebAssembly types](./types.md), it not only provides [low-level built-ins](./environment.md#low-level-webassembly-operations) to access WebAssembly features directly, making it suitable as a thin layer on top of Wasm, but also comes with its own JavaScript-like [standard library](./environment.md#standard-library), making it suitable for non-browser use cases, along a relatively small [managed runtime](./runtime.md) \(with memory management and garbage collection\) enabling the creation of programs that look and feel much like TypeScript.

For example, on the lowest level, memory can be accessed using the `load<T>(offset)` and `store<T>(offset, value)` built-ins that compile to WebAssembly instructions directly

```ts
store<i32>(8, load<i32>(0) + load<i32>(4))
```

while the standard library not only provides optimized native [Math](./stdlib/math.md) implementations \(both double and single precision\) but also implementations of [ArrayBuffer](./stdlib/arraybuffer.md), [Uint8Array](./stdlib/typedarray.md), [String](./stdlib/string.md), [Map](./stdlib/map.md) etc. on a higher level:

```ts
var view = new Int32Array(12)
view[2] = view[0] + view[1]
```

In turn it also comes with a bunch of features JavaScript doesn't have, mostly out of necessity, like the ability to declare [operator overloads](./peculiarities.md#operator-overloads) that arrays for example use as an implementation helper. It's not quite a subset, not quite a superset, but rather a variant.

As of today, the compiler still has its [limitations](./basics.md#current-limitations) and we are waiting for WebAssembly features that are currently undergoing specification \(marked as ðŸ¦„ throughout the documentation, especially [Reference Types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/reference-types) ðŸ¦„, [Interface Types](https://github.com/WebAssembly/interface-types) ðŸ¦„ and [Wasm GC](https://github.com/WebAssembly/gc) ðŸ¦„\) to unleash its full potential. But it is open source, built upon an [open specification](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/) and everyone can contribute, so we are getting there.
