# Introduction

AssemblyScript compiles a **strict variant** of [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) \(a typed superset of JavaScript\) to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) using [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen), looking like:

```ts
export function fib(n: i32): i32 {
  var a = 0, b = 1
  if (n > 0) {
    while (--n) {
      let t = a + b
      a = b
      b = t
    }
    return b
  }
  return a
}
```

```sh
asc fib.ts -b fib.wasm -O3
```

Its architecture differs from a JavaScript VM in that it compiles a program **ahead of time**, quite similar to your typical C compiler. One can think of it as TypeScript syntax on top of WebAssembly instructions, statically compiled, to produce lean and mean WebAssembly binaries.

## In a nutshell

On top of [WebAssembly types](./types.md), AssemblyScript not only provides [low-level built-ins](./environment.md#low-level-webassembly-operations) to access WebAssembly features directly, making it suitable as a thin layer on top of Wasm, but also comes with its own JavaScript-like [standard library](./environment.md#standard-library) and a relatively small [memory management and garbage collection runtime](./garbage-collection.md), making it suitable as a general purpose higher-level language for WebAssembly today.

For example, on the lowest level, memory can be accessed using the `load<T>(offset)` and `store<T>(offset, value)` built-ins that compile to WebAssembly instructions directly

```ts
store<i32>(8, load<i32>(0) + load<i32>(4))
```

while the standard library provides higher-level implementations of [Array](./stdlib/array.md), [ArrayBuffer](./stdlib/arraybuffer.md), [DataView](./stdlib/dataview.md), [Math](./stdlib/math.md) (double and single precision), [Uint8Array](./stdlib/typedarray.md), [String](./stdlib/string.md), [Map](./stdlib/map.md), [Set](./stdlib/set.md) etc.:

```ts
var view = new Int32Array(12)
view[2] = view[0] + view[1]
```

It is worth to note, however, that AssemblyScript still has its [limitations](./basics.md#current-limitations) and a few implementation-specific [peculiarities](./peculiarities.md), and we are patiently waiting for [future WebAssembly features](#status) (marked as ü¶Ñ throughout the documentation) to become available for us to use.

## Status

Not all TypeScript features are equally trivial or efficient to implement on top of the current state of WebAssembly. AssemblyScript is fun and useful already, yet there's still a lot to do. The following table aims at giving an overview of future WebAssembly features and their status, that will hopefully help AS reach its full potential eventually:
