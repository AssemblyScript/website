# Map

A mapping of generic keys to generic values.

The Map API is very similar to JavaScript's \([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map)\), with the notable difference that a `.get` with a key that does not exist results in an error, because `undefined` cannot be represented. Example:

```ts
var map = new Map<i32,string>()

// Because `undefined` cannot be represented if a key is not found, this will error:
var str = map.get(1) // ERROR

// The error can be avoided by first making sure that the key exists, so this works:
var str: string | null = map.has(1) ? map.get(1) : null // OK
```

## Constructor

* ```ts
  new Map<K,V>()
  ```
  Constructs a new map mapping keys of type `K` to values of type `V`.

## Instance members

### Fields

* ```ts
  readonly size: i32
  ```
  The current number of key-value pairs in this map.

### Methods

* ```ts
  function clear(): void
  ```
  Clears the map, deleting all key-value pairs.

* ```ts
  function delete(key: K): bool
  ```
  Deletes the key-value pair for the corresponding key. Returns `true` if the key did exist, otherwise `false`.

* ```ts
  function get(key: K): V
  ```
  Gets the value corresponding to the specified key. Traps if the key does not exist because "not found" cannot be represented in all cases \(use `Map#has` to check\).

* ```ts
  function has(key: K): bool
  ```
  Tests if the specified key exists.

* ```ts
  function keys(): Array<K>
  ```
  Gets the keys contained in this map as an array, in insertion order. This is preliminary while iterators are not supported.

* ```ts
  function set(key: K, value: V): void
  ```
  Sets the value for the specified key. Creates a new key-value pair if the key did not exist.

* ```ts
  function values(): Array<V>
  ```
  Gets the values contained in this map as an array, in insertion order. This is preliminary while iterators are not supported.

* ```ts
  function toString(): string
  ```
  Returns a string representation of this map.
