# Math

Mathematical operations as known from JavaScript.

The Math API is very much like JavaScript's \([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)\), with the notable exceptions stated above and rest parameters not being supported yet.

## Variants

Math in AssemblyScript is available in multiple variants.

| Variant     | Description
| :---------- | :----------
| NativeMath  | WebAssembly implementation for `f64`
| NativeMathf | WebAssembly implementation for `f32`
| JSMath      | JavaScript implementation for `f64` (imported from the host)

By default, the global `Math` object is an alias of `NativeMath` and `Mathf` is an alias of `NativeMathf` .

### Using JSMath

By default, the compiler utilizes `NativeMath` which is implemented in WebAssembly directly, but where small module size is more important than performance, one can opt to override the default by adding `--use Math=JSMath` on the command line, essentially aliasing `Math` with `JSMath` instead, which maps to an import of the browser's math implementation. Naturally, this option requires importing the browser's `Math` object as a whole, but does not require seeding / is not seedable. Generated bindings automatically take care of importing the browser's math in this scenario.

## Static members

The type `T` below substitutes either `f32` or `f64` depending on the implementation used. Note that `Math` is not actually generic, but concrete implementations like `Math` and `Mathf` have an identical interface that only differs in the implementation's floating-point precision denoted by `T`.

  ```
  Returns the result of the C-like 32-bit multiplication of `a` and `b`.

* ```ts
  function random(): T
  ```
  Returns a pseudo-random number in the range from 0.0 inclusive up to but not including 1.0.

  Note that `Math.random` needs a way to seed the random number generator, which is achieved with a [special import](../concepts.md#special-imports) `env.seed` returning the seed as an `f64` value. Generated bindings and WASI take care of it automatically.

* ```ts
  function signbit(x: T): bool
  ```
  Returns whether the sign bit of `x` is set.

* ```ts
  function sin(x: T): T
  ```
  Returns the sine of `x`.

* ```ts
  function trunc(x: T): T
  ```
  Returns the integer part of `x` by removing any fractional digits.

## Considerations

The Math implementations are meant as a drop-in replacement for JavaScript's `Math` with all its quirks. For example, `Math.round` always rounds towards `+Infinity` and `Math.imul` and similar functions operate on `number`, which is `f64` in AssemblyScript. Hence, using [WebAssembly's math instructions](./globals.md#math) directly where possible is often more efficient.
