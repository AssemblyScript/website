# String

A fixed-length sequence of UTF-16 code units.

The String API works very much like JavaScript's \([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)\), with the notable difference that the `string` type is an actual alias of `String`.

## Static members

* ```ts
  function fromCharCode(unit: i32, surr?: i32): string
  ```
  Creates a one character long string from the specified UTF-16 code units.

* ```ts
  function fromCharCodes(units: u16[]): string
  ```
  Creates a string from a sequence of UTF-16 code units.

* ```ts
  function fromCodePoint(code: i32): string
  ```
  Creates a one character long string from the specified UTF-8 code point.

* ```ts
  function fromCodePoints(codes: i32[]): string
  ```
  Creates a string from a sequence of UTF-8 code points.

## Instance members

### Fields

* ```ts
  readonly length: i32
  ```
  The length of the string in UTF-16 code units.

### Methods

* ```ts
  function charAt(pos: i32): string
  ```
  Gets the UTF-16 code unit at the specified position as a single character string. Returns `""` \(empty string\) if out of bounds.

* ```ts
  function charCodeAt(pos: i32): i32
  ```
  Gets the UTF-16 code unit at the specified position as a number. Returns `-1` if out of bounds.

* ```ts
  function codePointAt(pos: i32): i32
  ```
  Gets the UTF-8 code point at the specified \(UTF-16 code unit\) position as a number, possibly combining multiple successive UTF-16 code units. Returns `-1` if out of bounds.

* ```ts
  function concat(other: string): string
  ```
  Concatenates this string with another string, in this order, and returns the resulting string.

* ```ts
  function endsWith(search: string, end?: i32): bool
  ```
  Tests if the strings ends with the specified string. If specified, `end` indicates the position at which to stop searching, acting as if it is the length of the string.

* ```ts
  function includes(search: string, start?: i32): bool
  ```
  Tests if the string includes the search string. If specified, `start` indicates the position at which to begin searching.

* ```ts
  function indexOf(search: string, start?: i32): i32
  ```
  Gets the first index of the specified search string within the string, or `-1` if not found. If specified, `start` indicates the position at which to begin searching.

* ```ts
  function lastIndexOf(search: string, start?: i32): i32
  ```
  Gets the last index of the specified search string within the string, or `-1` if not found. If specified, `pos` indicates the position at which to begin searching from right to left.

* ```ts
  function padStart(length: i32, pad: string): string
  ```
  Pads the string with the contents of another string, possibly multiple times, until the resulting string reaches the specified length, returning the resulting string.

* ```ts
  function padEnd(length: i32, pad: string): string
  ```
  Pads the string with the contents of another string, possibly multiple times, until the resulting string reaches the specified length, returning the resulting string.

* ```ts
  function repeat(count?: i32): string
  ```
  Repeats the string `count` times and returns the concatenated result.

* ```ts
  function replace(search: string, replacement: string): string
  ```
  Replaces the first occurrence of `search` with `replacement`.

* ```ts
  function replaceAll(search: string, replacement: string): string
  ```
  Replaces all occurrences of `search` with `replacement`.

* ```ts
  function slice(start: i32, end?: i32): string
  ```
  Returns the region of the string from `start` inclusive to `end` exclusive, as a new string. If omitted, `end` defaults to the end of the string.

* ```ts
  function split(separator?: string, limit?: i32): string[]
  ```
  Splits the string at each occurrence  of `separator` and returns the result as a new array of strings that has a maximum of `limit` values. If `limit` is omitted, no limit is assumed. If `separator` is omitted or not present in the string, the string becomes the sole element of the array. If `separator` is an empty string, the split is performed between code units \(not code points\), potentially destroying surrogate pairs.

* ```ts
  function startsWith(search: string, start?: i32): bool
  ```
  Tests if the string starts with the specified string. If specified, `pos` indicates the position at which to begin searching, acting as the start of the string.

* ```ts
  function substring(start: i32, end?: i32): string
  ```
  Gets the part of the string in between `start` inclusive and `end` exclusive as a new string.

* ```ts
  function toString(): this
  ```
  Returns the string.

* ```ts
  function trim(): string
  ```
  Removes white space characters from both the start and the end of the string, returning the resulting string.

* ```ts
  function trimStart(): string
  function trimLeft(): string
  ```
  Removes white space characters from the start of the string, returning the resulting string.

* ```ts
  function trimEnd(): string
  function trimRight(): string
  ```
  Removes white space characters from the end of the string, returning the resulting string.

## Encoding API

### UTF8

When integrating with an environment that uses UTF-8, the following helpers can be used to quickly re-encode String data.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF8.byteLength(str: string, nullTerminated?: bool): i32
  ```
  Calculates the byte length of the specified string when encoded as UTF-8, optionally null terminated.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF8.encode(str: string, nullTerminated?: bool): ArrayBuffer
  ```
  Encodes the specified string to UTF-8 bytes, optionally null terminated.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF8.decode(buf: ArrayBuffer, nullTerminated?: bool): string
  ```
  Decodes the specified buffer from UTF-8 bytes to a string, optionally null terminated.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF8.decodeUnsafe(
    buf: usize,
    len: usize,
    nullTerminated?: bool
  ): string
  ```
  Decodes raw UTF-8 bytes to a string, optionally null terminated.

::: tip
Note that any `ArrayBuffer` return value is a pointer to the buffer's data internally and thus can be passed to let's say a C-function directly. However, if the pointer is meant to live longer than the immediate external function call, the [lifetime of the buffer must be tracked](../runtime.md#managing-lifetimes) so it doesn't become collected prematurely with the data becoming invalid.

### UTF16

The following mostly exist to have a safe way to copy between Strings and ArrayBuffers, but doesn't involve a re-encoding step.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF16.byteLength(str: string): i32
  ```
  Calculates the byte length of the specified string when encoded as UTF-16.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF16.encode(str: string): ArrayBuffer
  ```
  Encodes the specified string to UTF-16 bytes.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF16.decode(buf: ArrayBuffer): string
  ```
  Decodes the specified buffer from UTF-16 bytes to a string.

* ```ts
  function String.UTF16.decodeUnsafe(buf: usize, len: usize): string
  ```
  Decodes raw UTF-16 bytes to a string.

## Considerations

AssemblyScript stores strings [the same way JavaScript does](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding), i.e. by encoding them using UTF-16. In UTF-16, certain Unicode **code points** are represented by two UTF-16 **code units** called surrogate pairs. However, just like in JavaScript, strings are not sanitized so lone surrogates can appear in a string, which are technically ill-formed UTF-16. This is done to mimic JavaScript as closely as possible, and avoids string re-encoding when calling JavaScript APIs from WebAssembly. Whether future WebAssembly specifications will help in this regard is still [subject to discussion](https://github.com/WebAssembly/webidl-bindings/issues/13).
